This guide explains how to contribute correctly, step by step.

## Project philosophy
LibreWings aims to be:

We are not looking for absolute perfection, but for:
clear code, sensible ideas, and concrete improvements

## What you can contribute to
You can contribute in many ways, some of which are listed below:

## Code

All assets must be:

## Before you start
-Check the open Issues

This avoids duplicate work and unnecessary chaos

## Recommended workflow (step by step)
1️. Fork the repository

-Go to the LibreWings GitHub page

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LibreWings.git

Or use GitHub Desktop:

3️. Create a branch for your feature

-Never work directly on main.
-Recommended naming:

use the command:
git checkout -b feature/feature-name

4️. Work on the project

-Use Godot 4.5
-Keep the code readable
-Comment complex parts
-Follow the existing style

## Recommended structure:
-code → engine/
-scenes → godot_project/scenes/

5️. Clear and descriptive commits

Simple and honest commit messages:

✅ Good examples:
-Added basic radar tracking system

-update
-stuff

6️. Push and Pull Request

git push origin feature/feature-name

Then on GitHub:

## Pull Request review
All PRs are:
-read
-tested

Possible outcomes:
